# Golang Minecraft Server.

This project is unfinished but was a small try to learn the minecraft net protocol and networking in general

Several sources have been used for decrypting network packages such as VarInts.
And most importantly [the minecraft protocol wiki](https://wiki.vg/Protocol).

This project was discontinued very fast due to the use of NBT in network packages and no public golang libraries to encode/decode NBT data.

Furthest this project came was being able to receive readable data from a minecraft server ping from an actual minecraft client.
